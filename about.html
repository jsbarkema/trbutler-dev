			<p>I've often said <em>(and many have agreed!)</em> that my job is to "read reports and criticize." But seriously, I do my best to apply my years of experience to overseeing the operation, keeping our business profitable and keeping our team inspired.</p>
			<p>I've been happily married to my wife, Carole, for 50 wonderful years, and I enjoy spending time with her in our beautiful home. When I do leave the house, I enjoy traveling around the world and seeing new places, people and cultures. This also enables me to indulge my hobby of tasting and collecting fine wines.</p>
